# @writemorekid 

Welcome to `writemorekid` — my personal GitHub playground, where I document my journey of learning, building, and leveling up. 

## 🧠 About Me

I'm Rishabh — an aspiring student, a tech enthusiast, and a guy who believes in balancing logic with leadership. When I'm not preparing for the AFCAT or exploring OLQs, I'm usually experimenting with code, building Discord servers, or helping communities grow online.

This repo is a space for:
- Trying out new tech and tools
- Storing useful scripts and snippets
- Sharing small projects and ideas
- Evolving as a developer and a person

## ⚙️ Tools & Tech I Mess With

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C++, Bash
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code, Linux, Discord APIs
- **Projects:** Automation scripts, Discord bots, science notes in PowerPoint (yeah, I do that too 😄)
